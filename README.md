# Porrazzo-Analysis-of-climate-change-and-its-potential-impacts 
# Project description
Machine learning models and the large amount of data available can be very useful in analysing the development of climate change patterns or relevant contributors. In theory, national greenhouse gas emissions like CO2 over one year could depend on certain country-specific aspects. It is possible to develop an ML project that aims to analyse and predict CO2 emissions from country-specific parameters, such as economic indicators, population, energy use, land use, etc. based on the data provided by World Bank in kaggle
 [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/world-bank-climate-change-data).
